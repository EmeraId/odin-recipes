        <h2>Bean Pudding (Moi-Moi)</h2>
        <p>Moi moi (also called moin moin) is a delicious, savory steamed bean pudding made commonly in Nigeria from a mixture of blended black eyed peas or beans, peppers, onions, and spices.</p>
        <p>Growing up, my mom’s moi moi recipe always utilized steamed bean batter wrapped with leaves locally called ‘Ewe eran‘ in Lagos.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1.5 cups of black eyed peas</li>
                <li>1/2 large bell pepper</li>
                <li>2 scotch bonnet/ habanero peppers<li>
                <li>1/2 cup neutral unflavored oil I used sunflower oil</li>        
                <li>1/2 large onion I used a red onion</li>
                <li>8 oz smoked de-boned fish broken into small pieces</li>
                <li>3 tsp bouillon</li>
                <li>3 tsp salt or salt to taste</li>
                <li>1/4 – 1/2 cup hot boiling water</li>
                <li>3-4 broad sheets of banana leaves</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Step-by-step Preparation</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>To skin the beans, soak the beans in water for 3 minutes, after about 3 minutes, the skin of the beans should start wrinkling a little bit.</li>
                 <li>Place the beans in a food processor, with water, just enough to cover it, then pulse the food processor about 5- 6 times to agitate the beans. This process breaks the beans up and separates the skins from the beans. Watchout for splashing water!</li>
                 <li>Pour the skinned beans in a bowl. Rinse several times to wash off any loose skin, draining the skins with the water with each rinse. The skins should come off easily because the skins are lighter and should float easily to the top.</li>
                 <li>Once the beans are clean, soak them in water for at least 4 hours or over night.</li>
                 <li>After the beans have soaked, drain the water that they have been soaking in, and rinse the beans one more time.</li>
                 <li>Blend the beans with 1 cup of water, the bell pepper, scotch bonnet peppers, onions and bouillon.</li>
                 <li>Place the blended beans in a bowl, mix in the oil and salt thoroughly then thin out the mixture with the hot water until it resembles the texture of a light cake batter (you may need less than 1/2 a cup of hot water, just make sure the texture is like a light cake batter).</li>
                 <li>You can taste the mixture to adjust for salt (it is will not taste good at this point since the beans are raw but at this point you are just tasting for seasoning).</li>
                 <li>Wash your leaves if using any, wash with a light foam sponge and salt to remove dirt and debris, then cut off the stalks.</li>
                 <li>Fold your leaf in doubles, then scoop 2 cooking spoonfuls of batter into the folded leaves, add the Boiled Egg; either whole or half or as you desire, then fold over…</li>
                 <li>Repeat same process with the remaining batter till exhausted…</li>
                 <li>In a deep pot with a properly fitted pot cover, place a sheet of banana leaf, and pour boiling water into the pot till it is about 1 inch deep. Place the wraps of moi-moi into the pot, on top of the banana leaves. The hot water should not be more than half way up the wraps. Cover the wraps with a sheet of banana leaf</li>
                 <li>Depending on how wide your pot is, you may need to layer the wraps in the pot. To do that, simply place the additional wraps over the second sheet of banana leaf that covered the first layer, then cover that layer with another sheet of banana leaf.</li>
                 <li>Cover the pot, and allow it to steam on low heat for 50 minutes. After 50 minutes, check the Moi moi. Just like a cake, a skewer inserted into the middle of it should come out clean. If it doesn't, allow it to continue steaming for another 10 minutes.</li>
                 <li>Allow the Moi moi to sit for 5 minutes then serve warm in the leaves or unwrapped.</li>
            </ol>
