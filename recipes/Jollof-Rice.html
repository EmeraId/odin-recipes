        <h2>Egusi Soup</h2>
        <p>This vegan Nigerian jollof rice ("Party jollof") is a one-pot, tomato and pepper infused rice with a crispy layer at the bottom. The life of the party and ready in 30 minutes!</p>
        <p>We usually serve Jollof with Chicken, Turkey, Beef, Goat Meat,  Fish or moi moi and sometimes with a side of fresh creamy Coleslaw or Nigerian salad. In west Africa, a party such as a wedding ceremony or a naming ceremony is not complete without this meal. It is a sure party pleaser.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 Cups Rice Long grain</li>
            <li>3/4 Cup Olive Oil</li>
            <li>5 Tbsp Tomato paste</li>
            <li>4 Cups Chicken stock</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp Curry Powder and thyme</li>
            <li>4 cloves Garlic</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp Ginger Grated</li>   
            <li>1 Tsp Salt or to taste</li>        
            <li>1 Onion Medium sized(sliced)</li>
            <li>1 Tomato sliced (Large size)</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp seasoning powder or seasoning cubes</li>
            <li>1 Onion Sliced</li>
            <li> White People or black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pan, preheat the cooking oil. Once the oil is hot, add the diced onions and fry for about 3 to 5 minutes or till the onions become soft.</li>
            <li>Add the Tomato Paste. Fry for about 5 minutes, then add the garlic, ginger, and bay leaves and let it cook in the tomato paste for about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the blended pepper and allow the pepper to cook until the water is reduced entirely and the oil is seen floating on the fried pepper.</li>
            <li>Season with thyme, curry powder, salt to taste, and seasoning cubes. Leave to cook for another 2 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in the rice until it is well coated with the sauce. Add the Chicken stock and cover it with a tight-fitting lid, then allow it to come to a boil.</li>
            <li>Once it starts boiling - about 3 to 5 minutes after placing it on the stove, reduce the heat immediately to medium-low and steam until the rice is done.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat and add the sliced tomato and onions, and stir together briefly. Then, cover it up immediately so that the heat remaining in the rice can steam up the vegetables a little bit.</li>
            <li>You can serve with Plantains, Chicken, Vegetables or as desired. ENJOY!</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Notes: Normally, the bay leaves should be removed once the rice is done. However, if you can’t find the bay leaves after the rice is done, don’t be tempted to dig through it since over- stirring will cause the rice to break. Just leave it and remove it whenever you find it. If you choose not to use butter, you will need to add an extra tbsp of Oil</p>
